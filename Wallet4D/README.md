# Project Wallet4D

Wallet4D is a relay-app which connects various client apps that installed on user's mobile phone.

To simplify the connetion between Dapps and mobile wallets.
This relay-app has certain assumptions:

* User uses mobile wallets to store his/her private keys.
* User will open Dapp's webpage using his/her mobile phone.


By using this relay-app, user will be benefit from:

* Switching between multiple wallets
* Reliable connection between Dapps and Wallets without remote socket middle-server.
* Much better UX than default browser or in-app webview of wallets.

## Proposal
We have drafted why we are doing it and how, please refer to this document:
