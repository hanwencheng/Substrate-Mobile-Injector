The bounty includes the integration with Beacon SDK with Substrate-based Network, and the integration with Wallet in both iOS and Android. Overall the bounty is completed by Beacon team, Fearless Wallet team and Nova Wallet by June 2022.

The bounty include relatively more work which could be split into different stages. In order to cover the financial risk for development team, we decide to split the distribution of the bounty into 2 parts. The first part is distributed in November 2021 and rest of KSM is hold in a multi-sig wallet on KSM: FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6.
