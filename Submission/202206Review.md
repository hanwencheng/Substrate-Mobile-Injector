# Review on Bounty3 Submission on June 2022

[Bounty #3](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/3) aims to provide a signing solution to bridge the dApps and mobile wallets, which using Beacon Network as a decentralized peer to peer network of nodes based on the matrix protocol, with trustless and encrypted message relaying.

The bounty includes the integration with Beacon SDK with Substrate-based Network, and the integration with Wallet in both iOS and Android. Overall the bounty is completed by Beacon team, Fearless Wallet team and Nova Wallet by June 2022 as the deliverables are listed below.

## Beacon Team

[Detail Report](./202206Beacon_Submission.pdf)

- [x] Beacon Substrate messages
PermissionRequest is not include in the MessageType
https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-sdk/blob/v3.0.0/packages/beacon-blockchain-substrate/src/types/message-type.ts

- [x] Development Beacon Example dApp
https://andreasgassmann.github.io/apps/#/explorer

- [x] Beacon Typescript SDK
     - Beacon SDK: https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-sdk
 
- [x] Beacon Swift and Kotlin SDK
    - Kotlin Sdk: https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-android-sdk
    - Swift SDK: https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-ios-sdk
    
- [x] Beacon Node infrastructure setup
   - beacon-test-node-1.crystal.papers.tech 
   - beacon-test-node-2.crystal.papers.tech
     
- [x] Beacon SDKs developer documentation
  
Improvement need to be done:
1. PermissionRequest is not include in the MessageType
https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-sdk/blob/v3.0.0/packages/beacon-blockchain-substrate/src/types/message-type.ts
2. Current Beacon has two nodes infrastructure set up, need a document to guide user/projects on how to set up a replica relay node.
3. In the Beacon SDK's documentation, especially 
   - in the getting start part, there is no Substrate-related information, as you described before "document to make the developer onboarding process as smooth as possible", this part should be somehow added here.
   - in the first dApp part there is no Substrate is mentioned. Regarding the documentation, I suggest add the app side sample code in the https://github.com/AndreasGassmann/apps/blob/master/packages/react-api/src/Api.tsx and wallet side sample code with Nova or Fearless Wallet.
 

## Nova Wallet Team (iOS)

NOTICE: The feature is not release in production version of Nova wallet yet, as there is no usable application, which might create confusion for the current users.
After either the integration of Beacon with Polkadot.js extension or any application in production use Beacon SDK, the feature will come into alive.
