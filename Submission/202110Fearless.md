# The Review

The Fearless Wallet app could be installed by the TestFlight version, and it works well with the tested front-end app: [https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-polkadot-example-dapp](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-polkadot-example-dapp).

Anton regularly attends the meeting and contributes actively to the standard of the communication between wallet and dApps.
