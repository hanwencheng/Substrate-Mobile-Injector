# Summary


## Splited Tasks


    “Due to the uncertainties around the distribution of the bounty, as it was initially planned to be split up into multiple sub bounties, Papers had to temporairly halt the development in September until a viable solution was reached. The development will be picked up as soon as a first installment was made, at least partially covering the development cost accrued until now.”

As the core part of the SDK development task has been done in stage 0 and stage 1. I believe it is a good start, and the team has already proved its ability to complete the tasks. As the sub-bounty feature is not yet integrate into Kusama. I think it is OK to distribute the KSM for the tasks already been done, to resolve the uncertainties around the distribution of the bounty and encourage the team to continue the development.

The rest part of the KSM token will be distributed to the Beacon teams once the tasks of phase 2 - phase 6 are finished, as well as the rest of work in phase 0 - phase 1. That means all the tasks need to be finished for the next KSM distribution.


## Token Distribution
